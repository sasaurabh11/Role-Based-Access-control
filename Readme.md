Description
The Admin Dashboard is designed to help administrators manage users, roles, and permissions. It allows creating, editing, and deleting users and roles, assigning permissions, and configuring roles with custom attributes. It also simulates server-side operations using mocked API endpoints for seamless testing.

Features
User Management: View, create, edit, and delete users.
Role Management: Define roles with customizable permissions.
Permission Assignment: Assign or modify permissions directly to roles.
Simulated Backend API: Mock API endpoints for user and role management (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Responsive UI: Built with modern web technologies and user-friendly design patterns.
Tech Stack
Frontend
React.js - JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Material-UI - A popular React component library for UI components.
Redux - State management for application-wide state.
Axios - For making HTTP requests.
Backend (Optional)
Node.js - JavaScript runtime environment.
Express.js - Web application framework for Node.js.
Mock Data - Simulates backend data (e.g., user roles, permissions).
Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (version 14 or higher)
NPM or Yarn (for managing dependencies)
Setup
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/admin-dashboard.git
cd admin-dashboard
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
# or
yarn install
Start the Development Server:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
This will start the development server and open your project in http://localhost:3000 in the browser.

Run the Backend Server (Optional):

If you want to simulate API endpoints for CRUD operations, run the following commands from the backend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm install
npm run start
The backend server will be available at http://localhost:5000.

Backend API Endpoints (Mocked)
Users Management
GET /api/users - Fetch all users.
POST /api/users - Create a new user.
PUT /api/users/:id - Update an existing user.
DELETE /api/users/:id - Delete a user.
Roles Management
GET /api/roles - Fetch all roles.
POST /api/roles - Create a new role.
PUT /api/roles/:id - Update an existing role.
DELETE /api/roles/:id - Delete a role.
Permissions Management
GET /api/permissions - Fetch all permissions.
POST /api/permissions - Create a new permission.
PUT /api/permissions/:id - Update an existing permission.
DELETE /api/permissions/:id - Delete a permission.
Usage
Login: Access the admin dashboard by navigating to http://localhost:3000.
User Management: Create, edit, and delete users.
Role Management: Define roles and assign permissions.
Permission Management: Assign permissions to roles.
Test Backend Simulations: You can use tools like Postman to make HTTP requests to the mock API endpoints.
